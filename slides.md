# Project File Structure


Nuxt.js offers a clear and well-organized project structure that significantly simplifies managing your Vue.js codebase. This is especially advantageous for larger projects where maintaining an organized codebase can be challenging. Nuxt's structure ensures that your code stays clean and easy to navigate, regardless of the project's complexity.

<img
  v-click
  class="mt-15"
  src="/assets/app.png"
  alt="nuxt app"
/>


<!--
 Έχει ένα οργανωμένο file structure που βοηθάει στο να συντηρήσεις ένα καλά οργανωμένο και καθαρό codebase όσο μεγάλο και περίπλοκο και αν είναι το project.

# File Based routing

Nuxt includes a file-based routing system that removes the need for manual route configuration in most cases. Rather than manually setting up routes, you simply create specific Vue files for each route within the pages directory. This intuitive and convenient method allows you to easily map your application's structure in a way that directly aligns with your project's file architecture.

<img
  v-click
  class="mt-15"
  src="/assets/hello-world.png"
  alt="hello world"
/>

<img
  v-click
  class="mt-15"
  src="/assets/id-vue.png"
  alt="dynamic routing"
/>



<!--
 <NuxtPage> is a wrapper around <RouterView> component from Vue Router.

 Nuxt automatically resolves the name and route by scanning and rendering all Vue component files found in the /pages directory.

 Αυτόματα δημιουγεί τα routes σκανάρωντας τα αρχεία που είναι στον φάκελο pages.
 Υποστιρίζει δυναμικές σελίδες, δημιουργώντας ένα αρχείο τύπου [id].vue και αντίστοιχα στην σελίδα αυτήν μπορείς να διαβάσεις την παράμετρο του url.

# Auto-imports

Nuxt.js simplifies the development process with auto-importing feature. 
This feature automatically imports components, composables, and utilities, helper functions and Vue APIs, reducing the need for repetitive import statements and allowing developers to focus more on building functionality.

<div class="mt-20">


````md magic-move {lines: true}
```vue {*|4-5}
// example 1 
<script setup lang="ts">
/* ref() and computed() are auto-imported */
const count = ref(1)
const double = computed(() => count.value * 2)
</script>
```

```vue {*|4}
// example 2
<script setup lang="ts">
/* useFetch composable is auto-imported */
const { data, refresh, pending } = await useFetch('/api/hello')
</script>
```
````
</div>
<div v-click class="mt-5">
```ts
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  imports: {
    autoImport: false
  }
})
```
</div>

<!--
 Ακολουθώντας τα rules για το file structure κάνει auto import, composables, components, helpers καθώς επίσης και το VueAP αφαιρώντας από τον developer έναν έξτρα φόρτο των import.

 Μπορείς αν θες να απενεργοποιήσεις το auto import feature

# Server-Side Rendering

Benefits of server-side rendering:

-   Faster initial page load time: Nuxt sends a fully rendered HTML page to the browser, which can be displayed immediately. This can provide a faster perceived page load time and a better user experience (UX), especially on slower networks or devices.
-   Improved SEO: search engines can better index SSR pages because the HTML content is available immediately, rather than requiring JavaScript to render the content on the client-side.
-   Better performance on low-powered devices: it reduces the amount of JavaScript that needs to be downloaded and executed on the client-side, which can be beneficial for low-powered devices that may struggle with processing heavy JavaScript applications.
-   Better accessibility: the content is immediately available on the initial page load, improving accessibility for users who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies.
-   Easier caching: pages can be cached on the server-side, which can further improve performance by reducing the amount of time it takes to generate and send the content to the client.

Overall, server-side rendering can provide a faster and more efficient user experience, as well as improve search engine optimization and accessibility.


<style>
  li{
    color: white;
    font-size:12px;
    font-weight: 300;
  }
</style>


<!--

 Better performance σε συσκευές μικρής δυναμικότητας καθώς μειώνει τον όγκο των δεδομένων που πρέπει να κατεβούν και να εκτελεστούν στην πλευρά του χρήστη

 Καλύτερο accessibility, καθώς το περιεχόμενο είναι απευθείας διαθέσιμο με το άνοιγμα της σελίδας.

Downsides of server-side rendering:

-   Development constraints: Server and browser environments don't provide the same APIs, and it can be tricky to write code that can run on both sides seamlessly. Fortunately, Nuxt provides guidelines and specific variables to help you determine where a piece of code is executed.
-   Cost: A server needs to be running in order to render pages on the fly. This adds a monthly cost like any traditional server. However, the server calls are highly reduced thanks to universal rendering with the browser taking over on client-side navigation. A cost reduction is possible by leveraging [edge-side-rendering](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#edge-side-rendering).


The current platforms where you can leverage ESR are:

-   [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) with zero configuration using the git integration and the `nuxt build` command
-   [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/features/edge-functions) using the `nuxt build` command and `NITRO_PRESET=vercel-edge` environment variable
-   [Netlify Edge Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/#netlify-edge-functions) using the `nuxt build` command and `NITRO_PRESET=netlify-edge` environment variable




<style>
  li{
    color: white;
    font-size:12px;
    font-weight: 300;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
  }
</style>


<!--
Ο server και ο browser δεν υποστιρίζουν τα ίδια api έτσι θέλει προσοχή ο κώδικας να μπορεί να εκτελεστεί και στις δύο πλευρές.

Κόστος, γιατί χρειάζεται έναν σέρβερ για να κάνει render τις σελίδες on the fly

# Client-Side Rendering

Benefits of client-side rendering:

-   Development speed: When working entirely on the client-side, we don't have to worry about the server compatibility of the code, for example, by using browser-only APIs like the `window` object.
-   Cheaper: Running a server adds a cost of infrastructure as you would need to run on a platform that supports JavaScript. We can host Client-only applications on any static server with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. 



<style>
  li{
    color: white;
    font-size:12px;
    font-weight: 300;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
  }
</style>

<!--

 -->

transition: slide-up
layout: default-3
---

Downsides of client-side rendering:

-   Performance: The user has to wait for the browser to download, parse and run JavaScript files. Depending on the network for the download part and the user's device for the parsing and execution, this can take some time and impact the user's experience.
-   Search Engine Optimization: Indexing and updating the content delivered via client-side rendering takes more time than with a server-rendered HTML document. This is related to the performance drawback we discussed, as search engine crawlers won't wait for the interface to be fully rendered on their first try to index the page. Your content will take more time to show and update in search results pages with pure client-side rendering.


You can enable client-side only rendering with Nuxt in your nuxt.config.ts

<div v-click>
```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ssr: false
})
```
</div>


<style>
  li{
    color: white;
    font-size:12px;
    font-weight: 300;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
  }
</style>

# Extensibility
  Allowing developers to easily extend and enhance the functionality, integrating modules for various purposes, such as 
  Nuxt Laravel Sanctum authentication (nuxt-auth-sanctum), PWA support (@nuxt/pwa), Pinia Store (@pinia/nuxt).

````md magic-move {lines: true}
```ts {*|2}
// step 1 
npm i @pinia/nuxt
```

```ts {*|4|6}
// step 2 nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: [
      '@pinia/nuxt',
      // Load a local module
      './modules/example',
    ],
})
```
